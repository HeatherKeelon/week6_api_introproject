# API Lecture Notes

Don't forget to run 'npm install' in your console.

Practice project after API lecture. Assignment was to set up an account on giantbomb.com/api, and use the api to access information and get that information posted to the DOM. Students could use AngularJS or JQuery for the client-side code. I chose to use AngularJS. Information was appended to the DOM using ng-repeat, and a filter was added to target only games. I added a form field with a search button so that the user could search for game titles.
